## Book Title:

## Book Subtitle (include keywords that aren't in the title):

## Author Name(s):

## Page Count (your best estimate - allow 300 words to a page):

## Overview

Describe your book. Tell us:

* what core technologies/topics you'll be writing about, and who your audience is (especially what skills they should already have);
* what real-world problems you'll be solving, and how you'll approach the topic (e.g. building a test application, cookbook style recipes, short exercises, anecdotes from real-life stories, etc.);
* why you are excited about this particular topic and why we should be excited about your book.

Imagine that this text is on the back of your book and you're selling your book to the reader. Telling us too much is better than telling us too little.

## Outline

List the chapter titles and a sentence explaining what the chapter covers. It's OK if you only have a rough outline at this stage, but we need to see what the reader's journey will be in the book and get an understanding of how you intend to approach the topic.

## Bio

Write a third-person bio that tells us who you are and what you do. Tell us about your experience and relation to the topic. Have you spoken publicly or written any material on this topic already? Are you active in the community? How might a reader get in touch with you (e.g. Twitter handle, LinkedIn address, your own blog)? Imagine that this bio will be displayed next to your book on pragprog.com.

## Competing Books

List the books that compete indirectly or directly and tell us how yours is different and better. Why would a reader choose your book over the others that are on the market?

## PragProg Books

List any of our existing books that relate to yours. Which books might a reader need to look at first or might they be able to use after they've read yours?

## Market Size

Tell us your opinion on the market for your book. Include metrics like the number of starred projects on GitHub, number of members in related online communities, number of conference talks on this topic, etc.

## Promotional Ideas

We have a marketing team who will help promote your book. What inside info can you give them? Think webinars, courses, conference talks, blogs, meet-up groups, anything you can participate in to promote your book. What ideas do you have?

## Writing Sample(s)

We would love to see an example of your writing. If you've written any other books, please link to them here and, if possible, send us a sample chapter from somewhere in the middle of your most recent book as a separate attachment. If you've never written a book but you have written online tutorials, blog posts, or anything else designed to teach people how to do something technical, please point us to where we can see those writing samples ourselves. And if you've never done any sort of public writing before, that's okay. We may also ask you to send us a five-to-seven-page example draft from the book you'd like to publish with us after we've reviewed your proposal, but we'll provide more details on that when the time comes.
