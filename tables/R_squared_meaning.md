| Fit Category   | \( R^2 \) Range         | Explanation                                                                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Excellent Fit  | \( R^2 > 0.9 \)        | - Indicates a very good fit. The model explains most of the variance in the target variable.                     |
|                |                        | - Typically seen in well-controlled environments with high-quality data.                                         |
| Good Fit       | \( 0.75 < R^2 < 0.9 \) | - Indicates a good fit. The model explains a significant portion of the variance.                                |
|                |                        | - Common in many practical applications with reasonably well-behaved data.                                       |
| Acceptable Fit | \( 0.5 < R^2 < 0.75 \) | - Indicates an acceptable fit. The model explains a moderate portion of the variance.                            |
|                |                        | - Useful in fields where data is inherently noisy or complex.                                                    |
| Poor Fit       | \( R^2 < 0.5 \)        | - Indicates a poor fit. The model explains less than half of the variance.                                        |
|                |                        | - Might still be acceptable in certain fields or applications, but generally indicates the need for further model improvement. |
